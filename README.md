# VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) Project

This repository contains the implementation of a custom made Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for finding the ground state energy of a given Hamiltonian by simulating the Heisenberg Spin Model using VQE with Random Circuit Ansatz. The VQE algorithm is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that leverages the power of quantum computers to solve optimization problems.
